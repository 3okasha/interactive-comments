### Useful resources

- [TheNetNinja Channel]()

## Development
- Use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- Using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted. Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file.
